Able to update database from Kivy app. 








For each challenge, cycle through this:

<Challenge> # Specific from the KL
	What's been great about this problem?
	What's wasn't perfect yet?
	What have I* done to make things the way I* want it? 
	What have I* stopped doing to make things the way I* want it?
	How have I* enjoyed the process while I* did what's necessary to make things the way I* want it? 
	
	CSQ
	
	
# Haha I like to write in Kivy Lang a lot 	
	 
<Modulization>
	Description: 'how to differentiate the different instances of MmpModule (i.e. how can I* index them, and reference each instantiation specifically--calling on them proceduarly... using data from the database/function to populate the values of the properties?)'
	

Always be asking: 'What's my momentum?'

Need specific types of restrictions
Need to update teammates list based on availability and restriction
cpython not being able to actually run threads at the same time, especially with a gui like qt that's designed around signals/slots which are thread safe

	
	
	

create a set of all teammates
Order the positions from least training to most training using a for loop
For each position, in this order:
	create a set of all people with required training, removing them from the global list
	Randomly pick a person for the position--put the rest back in the global list

	
	
Maybe convert buttons to ListItemButtons?
How do I* access specific positions--creating a list of all the positions as a set of dictionaries--
	
Remove unneeded items
Make it safe
Gist should automatically allow pulls to a GitHub directory


Improvements - SQLite3 should not require a tuple for a single dynamic value--auto-tupify
